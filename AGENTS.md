# AGENTS.md

Orientation for **all AI coding assistants** working in this repository
(Claude Code, ChatGPT Codex, Gemini/Antigravity, ...). This is the
canonical agent documentation — CLAUDE.md is only a pointer here, kept
because Claude Code auto-loads that filename. Created 2026-08-16 as part
of a session hand-off; see [`handoff/`](handoff/README.md) for the state
of the two threads (app code-review, PDF parsing) that converge here, and
[`ISSUES.md`](ISSUES.md) for the **canonical open-issues list** — read
its "Where things stand" section before starting substantive work.

## What this is

A Shiny app implementing the Carlisle–Shafer Monte Carlo analysis of
baseline data in randomized controlled trials, used in Steve Shafer's work
as a journal editor detecting research fraud (references in README.md).
This is a **standalone project, unrelated to any other repository on this
machine**. Since the phase-1 restructure (2026-08-16, ISSUES.md issue 10,
plan in [`docs/package-restructure-plan.md`](docs/package-restructure-plan.md))
it is an **R package**, modeled on stanpumpR: `R/app_globals.R` (constants,
`sumz()`, `outputComments()` — was `global.R`), `R/app_ui.R` (`app_ui()`,
shinydashboard page — was `ui.R`), `R/app_server.R` (`app_server`,
validation pipeline + `P_Calc()` Monte Carlo — was `server.R`),
`R/app_run.R` (exported `run_app()`, attaches libraries, registers
`inst/www` under the `www/` resource prefix). `app.R` is a one-line shim.
Bundled assets live in `inst/www`; `Template.xlsx`, `Example.xlsx`, and
`IntegrityAnalysis.html` in `inst/extdata`, resolved with `system.file()`.
The user documentation's MASTER is `docs/user-guide.md` (issue 14) —
edit the Markdown, then regenerate the served HTML with the pandoc
command in its header comment; never edit `inst/extdata/IntegrityAnalysis.html`
directly, and keep the two in sync in the same commit.
The environment is renv-pinned — see the "renv" section below (the
early no-renv stance was reversed 2026-08-20; this line was stale
until the 2026-08-26 repo audit caught the contradiction). Since the
ParsePDF fold-in
(2026-08-17, issue 9) the package also contains the PDF parser
(`R/parseBaselineTable*.R`, `tokenize.R`, `pageLayout.R`, `aiFallback.R`,
`utils.R`, `writeIntegrityTemplate.R`, all internals `.pp`-prefixed) and
its testthat suite. Since the issue-4 consolidation (2026-08-19) the
suite (`tests/testthat/`, 514 assertions) also covers the app side -
input contract, known-answer Monte Carlo under fixed seeds, the full
headless pipeline, grid mechanics, round trips - all from synthetic data
and synthetic PDFs, no corpus or Carlisle files needed. When testing
uploads with `shiny::testServer`, ALWAYS stage a copy of the file in its
own subdirectory of `tempdir()` and upload the copy - the purge-on-exit
handler deletes uploaded paths.

The upload pipeline (since 2026-08-17 all input modes converge on one
editable grid — Steve's original vision): file (csv/xls/xlsx, **or an
article PDF**, parsed by the deterministic engine in a subprocess and
narrated in the comments log) → the **editable rhandsontable grid** (fix a
missing N or a mistyped SD in place; "Apply Edits & Revalidate") →
column-name normalization by grep (any "MEAN"-containing name that isn't
MEAN → `ROUND_MEAN`, "OBS" → `ROUND_OBSERVATION`, "TRIAL", "ROW"/"GROUP",
"NUMBER" → N) → per-line validation (continuous rows need N/MEAN/SD;
category rows must be numeric, integer-valued, with at least one NA in the
column) → per-trial `P_Calc()`: closed-form weighted means, Monte Carlo of
rounded simulated means (continuous) or simulated chi-square under fixed
margins (categorical), **mid-p** ties, rows combined with Stouffer's
`sumz()` into a **single one-sided p toward excessive homogeneity**
(issue 6: small p = data more similar across arms than random sampling
explains — the fraud signal; heterogeneity is deliberately not reported,
and the categorical branch takes the lower tail, not `chisq.test`'s
upper tail). A
failed PDF extraction is a round trip: the partial table is offered as a
download in the app's own input layout. Local hand-test PDFs, one per
parsing challenge: `corpus/` (see its README).

## Running, testing, deploying

- Use **R 4.5.3**: `"C:\Program Files\R\R-4.5.3\bin\Rscript.exe"` (its 4.5
  user library has all packages; the 4.6 library does not).
- Do not start R while the shell is in another project's directory — an
  renv-managed project there will hijack the library path.
- Run locally: install the package (`R CMD INSTALL --no-multiarch .`) then
  `IntegrityAnalysis::run_app()` — or `shiny::runApp()` on `app.R`.
- Deploy (since the phase-1 package restructure): install the package
  **from GitHub** so rsconnect records the GitHub source, then ship only
  the shim — the old hand-maintained `appFiles` list (and its risk of
  uploading the Carlisle spreadsheets) is gone:

  ```r
  remotes::install_github("StevenLShafer/IntegrityAnalysis")  # or @<branch> for a PR app
  rsconnect::deployApp(appDir = "C:/dev/IntegrityAnalysis",
    appName = "IntegrityAnalysis",       # or IntegrityAnalysis_PR_<n>
    appFiles = "app.R",
    account = "steveshafer", server = "shinyapps.io",
    forceUpdate = TRUE, launch.browser = FALSE)
  ```

  A locally-installed (`R CMD INSTALL`) copy will NOT deploy — shinyapps.io
  can only fetch the package from GitHub, so push first, deploy second.
  PR test apps are `IntegrityAnalysis_PR_<n>`; purge them after merging.
  **A PR test app must identify itself in the UI** (Steve's rule,
  2026-08-16): deploy it with an `app.R` of the form
  `IntegrityAnalysis::run_app(testNote = "PR #<n>: <what to test>")` —
  write that shim to a scratch directory and point `deployApp(appDir=)` at
  it, so the repository's production `app.R` is never edited. The note
  renders as an orange banner under the header, telling the tester which
  PR this is and what to look at without opening GitHub.
  (The pre-package procedure, for history: `handoff/2026-08-16-merged-handoff.md`.)
- Production: https://steveshafer.shinyapps.io/IntegrityAnalysis/
  (rsconnect account `steveshafer`).
- Headless functional testing pattern (until a real suite exists): drive
  the server with `shiny::testServer`; simulate `input$upload` with a
  one-row data.frame carrying `datapath`, and read `<<-`-mutated state via
  `session$env$...` (the test block only sees a clone).

## renv - the pinned environment

Adopted 2026-08-20 (Steve's decision). `renv.lock` is the single source
of truth for R (4.5.3) and every package version, because this tool's
verdicts must be reproducible: an integrity finding may be challenged,
and "the exact computational environment is on record" is part of the
defense. The known-answer tests pin the Monte Carlo values themselves;
the lockfile pins everything those values depend on.

- **Local**: the project `.Rprofile` auto-activates renv. After pulling
  a lockfile change, run `renv::restore()`. After adding a dependency
  (DESCRIPTION first - Imports or Suggests - then `renv::install()`),
  run `renv::snapshot()` and commit `renv.lock` in the same PR. The
  snapshot type is **explicit**: DESCRIPTION's runtime declarations
  (Imports, recursively) are recorded and nothing else. Dev tooling
  (testthat, rcmdcheck, rsconnect, remotes) deliberately FLOATS - its
  versions cannot affect the statistical results, and pinning it would
  drag hundreds of transitive suggests into the lockfile.
- **CI and deploys** restore from the lockfile
  (`r-lib/actions/setup-renv@v2` in `R-CMD-check.yaml`,
  `deploy-production.yaml`, `deploy-pr-app.yaml`), so the runner's
  library - and therefore the versions rsconnect writes into the
  manifest and shinyapps.io installs - are the locked ones.
- **Floating breakage is discovered on a schedule, not in an
  emergency**: `cran-canary.yaml` runs the full check every Monday
  against R "release" and latest CRAN. A red canary blocks nothing; it
  means "plan a lockfile refresh".
- **Refresh policy**: deliberately, roughly monthly or when the canary
  goes red - `renv::update()`, run the full suite (the known-answer
  tests are the arbiter; if an upgrade moves the pinned Monte Carlo
  values, re-pin them and say so in the commit), snapshot, PR.

## Working alongside other sessions

Multiple Claude sessions work this repository (proven 2026-08-21). The
standing rules, each learned from a real incident:

- **Unpushed work does not exist** (2026-08-16: a local branch was
  destroyed by a concurrent merge). Push immediately after committing.
- **The shared user library is nobody's**: this repo's sessions run on
  the renv project library, and batch jobs should use a private library
  from a git worktree (the 2026-08-21 install race invalidated a
  peer's measurements mid-run when the user library changed under it).
- **Do not switch branches in C:/dev/IntegrityAnalysis while a
  detached run launched from it is still loading** - long jobs load
  code once at start and are immune afterwards.
- **Check for peers before assuming a PR, branch, or push is yours** -
  `gh pr list` surprises happen (PRs 51/53 arrived from a parallel
  session mid-day). Cross-session messages can be exchanged with the
  SendMessage tool when coordination is needed.
- Long-running work in flight is recorded in ISSUES.md "Where things
  stand" with its log path - read that section FIRST in a new session.

## Security

Security must be assured before anything deploys (Steve's requirement,
2026-08-20). The threat model is specific and unusual: **the adversary is
the author of a manuscript under investigation.** An editor can be
induced to upload a file that author crafted, so every uploaded artifact
- spreadsheet, PDF, file *name* - is hostile input.

### The API surface (added 2026-08-26)

The REST service (issue 1) widened the model: the adversary is now the
manuscript author **plus anyone on the internet, with or without a
token**. Three app-side guarantees did NOT extend to it automatically,
and the review that found them is the reason the following are pinned
by `tools/securityCheck.R` property group 5 - do not remove one without
replacing the property:

- **Request size**: the app's `shiny.maxRequestSize` does not apply to
  plumber, which buffers a whole multipart body in memory before any
  handler runs. `inst/api/plumber.R`'s `sizelimit` filter rejects
  oversized bodies 413 by header, *before* auth, because the body
  arrives before the handler does.
- **Compute**: `/analyze` refuses a table above `.apiMaxRows` /
  `.apiMaxTrials` before simulating. plumber is single-threaded and the
  Monte Carlo escalates precisely on homogeneous-looking rows, so a
  crafted table could otherwise pin the service past App Runner's
  request timeout and starve `/health`.
- **Spreadsheets**: `.xlsx` is a zip, and the API's read runs
  in-process (unlike PDFs, which get the subprocess batcher).
  `.apiZipInflationOK` reads the zip directory's declared uncompressed
  sizes and refuses a bomb before a byte is inflated.
- **Returned CSVs are formula-sanitized** (`.apiCsvSafe`): the "our
  workbooks cannot smuggle formulas" property was proven for xlsx
  string cells and does NOT hold for `write.csv`. A row label like
  `=HYPERLINK(...)` parsed from a manuscript would execute when the
  editor opens the file.
- **The caller's AI key never touches disk**: `.ppSplitChildKey` keeps
  it out of the child options RDS and it travels by environment
  variable on the `system2` call (not argv, so invisible to `ps`).
- **Errors say nothing**: `pr_set_error` returns a fixed 500 body;
  plumber's default handler would return R condition text carrying
  tempdir paths or upload fragments.

Confirmed good and worth preserving: auth fails closed (no tokens
configured = nothing authorized), zip *upload* handling is unreachable
from the API (`expandZipUploads` is Shiny-only), filenames are
`basename()`d into a per-request tempdir, and issued tokens are
256-bit with only their hashes stored.

The standing conclusions of the 2026-08-20 full-repository review:

- **A malicious document cannot execute code here.** PDFs are parsed by
  poppler (via pdftools), which reads them as data and never runs their
  embedded JavaScript; in the app every parse runs in a subprocess with
  a 60-second OS timeout, so a crafted PDF can at worst crash or stall
  its own subprocess. Spreadsheet readers (read.csv, openxlsx, readxl)
  parse data, not code. Nothing in `R/` evaluates constructed code
  (`eval`, `parse(text=)`, `system`, shell) - the one subprocess
  launcher (`parseBaselineTableFiles.R`) shQuote()s every argument and
  runs `Rscript --vanilla`.
- **User text is escaped before it reaches HTML.** The comments log is
  rendered with `HTML()`; every message is escaped at the single entry
  point (`outputComments.R::.escapeHtml`) because uploaded file names
  flow into it.
- **Workbooks we write cannot smuggle formulas.** openxlsx writes
  character cells as strings; a grid cell starting with `=` stays text.
  `writeFormula()` is used only in local corpus tooling on our own
  strings, never on uploaded content.
- **The AI fallback is off in deployment** (`ai = "never"`), so
  manuscript text - and any prompt-injection payload inside it - never
  reaches an LLM from the app.
- **Deploy secrets stay out of reach.** Workflows trigger on
  `pull_request`, never `pull_request_target`; forked PRs get no
  secrets. The API key lives only in the environment, never in code.
- **Archives are extracted defensively.** Any zip/tgz handling must
  refuse absolute paths and `..` components, extract by basename into a
  fresh directory, cap entry count and total uncompressed size, and
  never recurse into nested archives.

**The gate:** `tools/securityCheck.R` mechanises the properties above
that a one-line diff could silently break, and runs in both
`R-CMD-check.yaml` (every PR) and `deploy-production.yaml` (before every
deploy - a failure stops the deploy). Run it locally with
`Rscript tools/securityCheck.R`. When adding code, keep it green
honestly: if a new feature genuinely needs a banned primitive, the
review happens FIRST and the script's allowlist is extended in the same
PR, with the reasoning in comments.

## Conventions

- Case sensitivity: shinyapps.io runs Linux — filenames in code must match
  exactly (the old `Global.R`-vs-`global.R` failure generalizes).
- Generous comments; every non-obvious or AI-drafted change carries a
  provenance header (origin, date, run/verified status) and in-place
  `FIX:`/rationale comments. See the tops of `R/app_globals.R`,
  `R/app_server.R`, and `parseCovariateTable.R` for the house style.
- Small, focused commits — one issue each. **Push immediately after
  committing**: two agents have shared this repository, and
  committed-but-unpushed work was already lost once when a merged branch
  was deleted (recovered in `81b03cf`). Unpushed work does not exist.
- Pull requests (Steve's rules, 2026-08-16): every PR **branches directly
  from `main`** — never stack a PR on another PR's branch; each PR is
  devoted to **one specific issue**, so its testing scope is obvious; and
  the PR description **opens with a plain statement of the change made**.
- `main` is **protected** (2026-08-17): force-pushes and branch deletion
  are blocked for everyone. Admin (Steve's account) can still push
  ordinary commits directly — used for documentation-only changes; code
  goes through PRs. If a push is rejected, do not try to work around the
  protection; rebase onto the current `main` and push normally.
- **`R-CMD-check` is a required status check on `main`** (2026-08-19,
  phase 5): every PR must pass the GitHub Actions R CMD check — which
  runs the full testthat suite on a bare Ubuntu runner — before it can
  merge. The workflow is `.github/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml`; it fails
  on ERRORs and tolerates the one documented `library()` WARNING (see
  the comment there). A PR whose check is red is not mergeable — fix
  the tests, never bypass.
- **The deploy trio is live** (2026-08-19, phase 5 complete):
  `deploy-production.yaml` redeploys production after `R-CMD-check`
  SUCCEEDS on a `main` commit (2026-08-20: it triggers on that
  workflow's completion and deploys that exact tested SHA, so the
  553-assertion suite passing before every deploy is a mechanism, not
  a convention; `workflow_dispatch` remains for manual redeploys);
  `deploy-pr-app.yaml` deploys `IntegrityAnalysis_PR_<n>` for
  every PR — banner auto-generated as "PR #n: <PR title>", link posted
  as a PR comment, redeployed on each push; `cleanup-pr-app.yaml`
  purges the app when the PR closes. So: DO NOT manually deploy
  production or PR test apps, and do not manually purge PR apps — the
  workflows do all three (the manual recipe below is for emergencies
  only). Secrets: `SHINY_TOKEN`/`SHINY_SECRET` (verified 2026-08-19),
  vars `SHINY_ACCOUNT`/`SHINY_APP_NAME`.
- No Bioconductor-dependent packages (the shinyapps.io image build breaks
  on them — that is why `metap` was replaced by a local `sumz()`).
- Keep secrets and per-user data out of `outputComments()` logs and out of
  bookmark state.

## The parser optimization loop

The PDF parser (the `R/` files prefixed with parse*/tokenize/pageLayout/
aiFallback, folded in from the ParsePDF package 2026-08-17, issue 9) is
the hardest problem in this repository, and it is **deliberately set up to
be re-attacked by large language models every few months**. If you are an
LLM reading this because Steve asked you to look for parser improvements,
this section is your map.

- **The problem**: extract the baseline demographics table ("Table 1") of
  a randomized controlled trial from an article PDF — one row per
  variable per arm, means/SDs/Ns with their printed rounding — using only
  the PDF text layer, deterministically. Journals differ in layout,
  column conventions, and font encodings (several journals print `=` or
  `±` as private-use glyphs; see the repairs pinned in the test suite).
- **The evidence**: [`corpus/ParseOutcomes.csv`](corpus/ParseOutcomes.csv)
  — the master sheet, one row per PDF in the 1,865-article corpus, with a
  binary outcome (**successfully parsed / not successfully parsed**) and a
  `COMMENTS` column: the steps taken when parsing succeeded, and where the
  process failed when it did not. Read the failures, then read the code.
  [`corpus/README.md`](corpus/README.md) documents the columns, the
  current baseline (71.9% parsed; 58% exact value recovery against
  Carlisle), and the regeneration command.
- **The corpus PDFs** are copyrighted and live locally at
  `C:/temp/journals` (`<journal>/<year>/<n.m>.pdf`) — never commit them.
  The test suite needs none of them (synthetic PDFs via `pdf()`).
- **The architecture**: [`docs/parsepdf-architecture.md`](docs/parsepdf-architecture.md)
  (with an HTML twin). Entry points: `parseBaselineTable()` (one PDF,
  deterministic-then-optional-AI), `parseBaselineTableFiles()` (batches;
  one subprocess per file with an OS timeout — never loop over PDFs
  in-process, ~2% hang poppler), `writeIntegrityTemplate()` (emits the
  app's input format). The AI fallback's prompt and JSON schema — part of
  the published method — are `.ppSystemPrompt()` and
  `.ppTableSchemaJson()` in `R/aiFallback.R`, written to be read.
- **The rules**: the deployed path stays deterministic and offline (the
  app screens *unpublished* manuscripts; same input must always give the
  same verdict). Keep the ~295-assertion test suite green and add a
  fixture for every new corpus defect found. Score any change both ways:
  parse rate (`corpus/buildParseOutcomes.R`) **and** value accuracy
  against Carlisle — parsing more tables while misreading more numbers is
  a regression.
