# PROVENANCE: new in phase 1 of the package restructure (Claude Code, model
# Claude Fable 5, 2026-08-16 — see docs/package-restructure-plan.md), adapted
# from stanpumpR's R/app_run.R. The library() calls are the ones that opened
# the old global.R, moved here verbatim: the app's code calls these packages
# unqualified (dashboardPage, read.xlsx, %do%, s.u, dqrnorm, ...), so they
# must be attached to the search path at launch, exactly as Shiny's
# auto-sourcing of global.R used to do. Qualifying every call with :: is
# phase 2+ work, if ever - stanpumpR ships this same pattern.

#' Launch the Integrity Analysis Shiny app
#'
#' @param countUsage count anonymous usage events (session starts and
#'   analyses run) to Steve's GoatCounter? Defaults to TRUE only when
#'   there is no `testNote`, i.e. production. See R/usageCount.R for
#'   the privacy design (the user's IP never reaches the counter).
#' @param testNote optional single string shown as a prominent banner under
#'   the header, naming the PR under test and what to look at (e.g.
#'   `"PR #6: function extraction - exercise upload, validate, analyze"`).
#'   PR test deployments (`IntegrityAnalysis_PR_<n>`) deploy an `app.R` that
#'   passes this; production passes nothing and shows no banner.
