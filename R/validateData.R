# validateData.R — the upload validation pipeline.
#
# PROVENANCE: moved out of app_server() in phase 2 of the package
# restructure (Claude Code, model Claude Fable 5, 2026-08-16). The body of
# the reactiveData() observer became validateData(); is_category() came
# with it. One deliberate change, verified bit-identical under fixed seeds
# (see the phase-2 PR): instead of mutating the server's session state with
# <<-, validateData() RETURNS everything it derives and app_server assigns.
# outputComments() reports STRUCTURAL problems (a missing column - nothing
# to paint) to the session log; per-cell problems communicate through the
# issues frame and the grid's colored cells alone (Steve's direction,
# 2026-08-19 - no explanatory text below the table). outputComments()
# recovers the active session itself, so being called from an ordinary
# function changes nothing. Every FIX comment travels with its code.

#' Is a column a category (count) column?
#'
#' A category column is numeric, integer-valued, and has at least one NA
#' (the NA rows are where the trial's continuous variables live).
#'
#' @param x a column of the uploaded table.
#' @return `TRUE` if the column should be treated as categorical counts.
#' @noRd
is_category <- function(x) {
  # Remove NAs first for efficiency, then check if all values are integers

  # FIX: text columns (e.g. a comments column) previously crashed the app:
  # as.integer() on character data yields NA, all() then returns NA, and
  # if (!NA) is a fatal error ("missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed").
  # A non-numeric column can never be a category (categories are counts).
  if (!is.numeric(x))
    return(FALSE)

  # If there are no na values, then it can't be a category
  if (sum(is.na(x)) == 0)

  # If the vector is empty after removing NAs then it is not a category

#' (continuous rows need N, MEAN and SD; category rows must not carry
#' continuous entries). Problems are reported line by line through
#' [outputComments()], which finds the active Shiny session on its own.
#'

#' @return a list: `FAIL` (logical), and on success the validated `DATA`

  # ---- the arm-size ceiling (Steve, 2026-08-28) ---------------------------
  # IntegrityAnalysis refuses a trial with more than .iaMaxArmN subjects
  # in any arm, for two reasons, both of which belong here rather than in
  # the API alone:
  #
  #   1. The Monte Carlo is expensive in N. Every replicate of a
  #      continuous row draws N values per arm, so cost is
  #      replicates x sum(N) - a large trial can occupy the only thread
  #      for many minutes.
  #   2. Trials that large are funded by major companies or government
  #      entities, which institute detailed auditing and statistical
  #      review before submission. An independent fraud screen adds
  #      little to a manuscript that has already had one.
  #
  # ENFORCED HERE, NOT IN apiService.R, because the documentation says
  # "IntegrityAnalysis won't analyze trials with N > 5000 in any arm" -
  # a statement about the PROGRAM. The ceiling used to live only in the
  # API, so the app had no limit at all and the sentence would have been
  # false for every user who opened the web page. Writing documentation
  # that the code does not honour is the same defect corrected in the
  # privacy statement on 2026-08-27; the fix is to make the code true,
  # not to soften the sentence.
  #
  # An investigator who genuinely needs a larger trial analysed can call
  # P_Calc() directly - the escape hatch is named in the user guide.
