# Shafer's request, after running all 654 A&A RCT submissions through the  #
# deterministic engine and through the AI engine separately and comparing: #
# the single largest deterministic deficit was the arm N. 583 skipped      #
# n (%) rows across the corpus were blocked ONLY on an unknown arm N, and  #
# the arm-N sets agreed with the AI reading on just 255 of 453 co-parsed   #
# files - while the Ns were nearly always printed somewhere: in the very   #
# n (%) cells being skipped, in the randomization sentence of the Methods, #
# or in the CONSORT flow labels.                                           #
#                                                                          #
# Everything here is deterministic - no AI service is called. Every        #
# recovered N is traceable: either to printed cells of the table itself    #
# (the count and its percentage bracket the arm size), or to a quoted      #
# sentence of the document, which is recorded and surfaced by              #
# reviewFlags() so a human can verify it against the CONSORT diagram.      #
# Status: run and verified by tests/testthat/test-armn-recovery.R and a    #
# full re-run of the 654-submission corpus.                                #

# A printed cell "13 (68.4%)" pins the arm size tightly: the true proportion
# lies within half a printed unit of 68.4%, so N = 13/p can only be an
# integer in [13/0.6845, 13/0.6835] = {19}. One cell with a one-decimal
# percentage is usually conclusive; several cells of the same arm intersect
# to a unique N even at zero decimals. This uses nothing but the printed
# table, so it is the most trustworthy recovery and is tried first.

# Feasible arm sizes for one printed "count (pct%)" cell. `dec` is the
# number of printed decimals of the percentage - it decides the bracket
# width, exactly as ROUND_MEAN does for the Monte Carlo.

# THE PERCENTAGE FILL LIVES IN R/failsafeTable.R.
#
# What stood here until 2026-09-09 was .ppFailsafeCounts(), with
# .ppRowStat(), .ppFailsafeExact and .ppFailsafeSweeps: the rule that
# chose each category LEVEL on its own table line by maximising that
# level's statistic against its own complement. It is deleted rather
# than kept, because while it existed it could still be reached - when
# the whole-table search could not run, the caller silently fell back to
# it, and the independent audit of 2026-09-09 (F1) found a page that
# then read p < 0.0001 where a valid reading of the same percentages
# gives 0.59.
#
# Its three defects are recorded in docs/method-history.md under
# 2026-09-08, and R/failsafeTable.R carries the measurements. The
# bracket itself, .ppCountBracket(), is still here and still used: which
# counts a printed percentage allows is arithmetic, and that part was
# never in doubt.

#      of the arm's name. All matching candidates must agree on one n.
#   2. ELIMINATION - every arm but one was name-matched and exactly one
#      distinct candidate value is left over.
#   3. POSITION, CONFIRMED BY THE TOTAL - no names matched at all, but the
#      number of allocation candidates equals the number of arms AND their
#      sum equals a stated randomized total. Document order is taken as
#      column order; that assumption is why the total confirmation is
#      mandatory, why any already-known arm N must agree with its
#      positional candidate, and why reviewFlags() reports the sentence.
