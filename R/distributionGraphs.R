# distributionGraphs.R - the PowerPoint deck of actual-vs-expected
# distributions (ISSUES.md issue 16).
#
# PROVENANCE: written by Claude Code (model Claude Opus 5), 2026-08-20,
# to Steve Shafer's design settled that day: the graphs Carlisle used in
# the 2012 Fujii analysis (PMID 22404311), where a reader SEES the
# baseline data hugging the mean more tightly than chance allows,
# rather than taking a p-value's word for it.
#
# THE DECK, three levels that differ in kind (issue 16 discussion):
#   - OVERALL (2+ trials): observed cumulative distribution of the
#     TRIAL p-values against the uniform diagonal expected under honest
#     sampling - the case-making figure of Carlisle 2012.
#   - PER TRIAL (2+ analyzable rows): the same picture within one
#     trial, over its ROW p-values.
#   - PER ROW, only under a p cutoff (default 0.01): a single row has
#     ONE observed value, so its slide shows the EXPECTED distribution
#     of the squared-error statistic - the Monte Carlo draws the engine
#     generates anyway (captured by P_Calc's collector, see
#     .stagedTail) - with a line where the observed value landed. A
#     graphical p-value: the exhibit to put in front of an author for a
#     specific variable. The cutoff keeps a 300-row analysis from
#     becoming 300 slides of wallpaper; the deck should END with the
#     smoking guns, not bury them.
#
# WHY POWERPOINT AND NOT EXCEL TABS (Steve's question, 2026-08-20):
# these graphs are exhibits - shown to editors-in-chief, integrity
# committees, an author being confronted - and slides are that habitat.
# Native Excel charts cannot express these figures cleanly (an ECDF
# against a diagonal, a density with an observed marker), and images
# pasted into worksheet tabs neither scale nor print well. The graphs
# are inserted via rvg as NATIVE OFFICE VECTOR GRAPHICS - every axis,
# step, and label individually editable in PowerPoint - which is what
# "paste as metafile" wants, done portably (EMF is a Windows-only
# device; the server is Linux).

#' A collector for P_Calc's per-row Monte Carlo draws
#'
#' Pass to [P_Calc()]'s `graphs` argument; each simulated row appends
#' `list(trial, row, kind, obs, draws, p)` to `$rows`. An environment so
#' accumulation crosses the per-trial P_Calc calls without copying.

# friendly, self-explanatory off-screen (these slides travel without a

#' Write the distribution-graphs PowerPoint

#' @param results P_Calc's accumulated output (as passed to

#' @param collector the [newGraphCollector()] the analysis ran with -
#'   source of row p-values (numeric even where the sheet shows

#' @param file path of the .pptx to write.
