# Ported 2026-08-15 by Claude Code (model: Claude Opus 5, Anthropic) from  #
# parseCovariateTable() in the Integrity-Analysis repository, drafted      #
# 2026-08-14 by Claude Code (model: Claude Fable 5) at Steve Shafer's      #
# request. The cell-level parsing logic is unchanged from that draft.      #
#                                                                          #
# Revised the same day, after runs against samples drawn from the corpus   #
# of 1,865 real journal PDFs in C:/temp/journals (5 articles, then 60,     #
# then a 250-article random sample - NOT the whole corpus) showed that the #
# original table-finding stage failed on most of them. Two defects, both   #
# fatal on real articles and both invisible against the synthetic          #
# fixtures:                                                                #
#                                                                          #
#   1. Journals are typeset in two columns, and a table usually sits in    #
#      one of them with body prose beside it. Clustering words into lines  #
#      by y across the whole page glued each table row onto a sentence of  #
#      prose, so the parser saw neither a caption nor a table. Lines are   #
#      now built inside one typographic column at a time                   #
#      (.ppPageBands() in pageLayout.R).                                   #
#   2. The caption was located with a regex over the joined line text and  #
#      only matched Arabic numerals, so "TABLE I Demographic data" - the   #
#      house style of Anaesthesia and CJA - never matched. Captions are    #
#      now found as adjacent words, Roman or Arabic                        #
#      (.ppCaptionAnchors()).                                              #
#                                                                          #
# Consequently the engine no longer picks one page by vocabulary and hopes #
# the table is on it. It enumerates every captioned table in the document, #
# scores each caption for baseline-ness, parses the most promising ones,   #
# and keeps whichever parse comes out best (.ppParseScore()).              #
#                                                                          #
# This file makes NO calls to any AI service. All table recognition is     #
# word-coordinate heuristics and regular expressions over the text layer   #
# extracted by pdftools (poppler), so the same PDF always gives the same   #
# answer and every number can be traced back to a printed cell.           #
#                                                                          #
# A third defect was found the same way and fixed here: a placebo arm       #
# headed "P" was being discarded as a p-value column, which also corrupted  #
# every row label in that table, since the label is everything left of the  #
# first surviving cell.                                                     #
#                                                                          #
# Status: run and verified against the synthetic PDFs in                   #
# tests/testthat/helper-syntheticPdf.R, the regression fixtures in         #
# tests/testthat/test-real-layouts.R, and a 250-article random sample of   #
# the corpus in C:/temp/journals, scored against Carlisle's hand-extracted #
# values. On that sample 70% of articles yield a table and 45% of the      #
# known mean/SD pairs are recovered exactly (see README "Validation").     #
# That is a drafting aid, not a substitute for reading the table: review   #
# every parsed value against the printed table before analyzing a          #
# submission.                                                              #

# Revised 2026-08-20 by Claude Code (model: Claude Fable 5) at Steve       #
# Shafer's request, after screening 654 RCT submissions from the A&A       #
# manuscript corpus (C:/Temp/AA) showed that SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPTS -       #
# the input the deployed app actually receives - defeated the engine in    #
# ways journal typography never does: margin line-number rails, legend     #
# sentences between the caption and the table, captions on a different     #
# page than their table, tables running over page breaks, and the gutter   #
# detector splitting a wide Word table into a labels band and a values     #
# band. Each repair is marked "2026-08-20" in place, and every layout is   #
# pinned as a synthetic fixture in test-manuscript-layouts.R. Run and      #
# verified against the 60-submission random sample and a 150-article      #
# corpus regression sample (see the PR for the measured numbers).          #

#' Parse a baseline table with the deterministic engine only
#'
#' Reads the baseline characteristics table out of `pdfFile` using word
#' coordinates and regular expressions. No AI service is contacted, so the
#' result is reproducible and every value can be traced to a printed cell.
#' [parseBaselineTable()] wraps this function and adds the optional AI
#' fallback; call this one directly when you need a purely deterministic
#' answer.
#'
#' How it works, in order:
#'
#' 1. `pdftools::pdf_data()` gives every word on every page with its x/y
#'    position (points, origin top-left).
#' 2. Each page is split into its typographic columns by finding the vertical
#'    gutters that few text lines write into. This matters: journals are set
#'    in two columns, and a table usually sits in one of them with body prose
#'    beside it, so lines have to be built inside a column rather than across
#'    the page.
#' 3. Every captioned table in the document is located by finding the word
#'    "Table" (or "TABLE", or "Tab.") followed by a numeral, Arabic or Roman.
#'    Each caption is scored for how much it sounds like a baseline table.
#' 4. The most promising candidates are parsed and the best result is kept.
#'    Within a candidate: words are clustered into lines by y, numeric cells
#'    are recognized by regular expression (mean +/- SD, mean (SD), n (%),
#'    n/m fractions such as sex 15/10, median \[IQR\], plain counts), cell
#'    x-midpoints are clustered into treatment-arm columns, a p-value column
#'    is detected and dropped, arm names and N are read from the header lines,
#'    and rows are expanded to one output line per arm.
#'
#' Anything the parser could not use is reported in `$skipped` rather than
#' silently dropped.
#'
#' @param pdfFile Path to the article or submission PDF. The PDF must have a
#'   text layer; a scanned image must be run through OCR first (for example
#'   `pdftools::pdf_ocr_text()`).
#' @param trial Value for the TRIAL column. Defaults to the PDF file name.
#' @param pages Integer vector of pages to search. `NULL` (default) searches
#'   the whole document.
#' @param layout `"auto"` (default) tries both a column-segmented and a
#'   full-width reading of each candidate page and keeps whichever parses
#'   better; `"columns"` forces column segmentation; `"single"` forces
#'   full-width, which is right for a table that spans the page.
#' @param parenIsSD How to read "a (b)" cells that carry no percent sign:
#'   `"auto"` decides from the footnotes ("mean (SD)"), the row label
#'   ("n (%)"), and continuous-variable keywords (age, weight, ...);
#'   `"sd"` always reads mean (SD); `"percent"` always reads n (%).
#' @param roundObsDelta ROUND_OBSERVATION is set to ROUND_MEAN +
#'   `roundObsDelta`. Observations are often recorded with one more digit than
#'   the reported mean, hence the default of 1. Set to 0 to make them equal.
#' @param maxCandidates How many captioned tables to attempt before giving up.
#'   Candidates are tried in order of caption score.
#' @param ocr Read the pages with OCR instead of the text layer, for scanned
#'   articles that have no text layer at all. Needs the `tesseract` package.
#'   Everything downstream is unchanged — OCR word boxes are converted to the
#'   same coordinates `pdftools::pdf_data()` reports — but the characters
#'   themselves are now fallible, so treat the result with more suspicion than
#'   a text-layer parse.
#' @param ocrDpi Rendering resolution for OCR. Higher is slower and not
#'   necessarily better; 300 is a reasonable default for journal scans.
#' @param pctApprox Opt in to APPROXIMATE percent conversion. Percent-block
#'   cells are normally converted to counts only when the printed percentage
#'   and the arm N pin exactly one integer; with `pctApprox = TRUE`, cells
#'   the bracket cannot pin fall back to `round(N x pct / 100)`. Every such
#'   value is recorded in `$approxCounts` and `$derivedCells` and reported
#'   by [reviewFlags()] - it is a computed approximation (off by up to half
#'   a printed unit of N/100), not a printed datum. Default `FALSE`.
#' @param quiet Suppress the progress and summary messages.
#'
#' @return An object of class `ParsePDFTable`: a list with
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{data}{data frame in Integrity-Analysis template layout - TRIAL,
#'       ROW, N, MEAN, SD, ROUND_MEAN, ROUND_OBSERVATION, then one column per
