# Ported 2026-08-15 by Claude Code (model: Claude Opus 5, Anthropic) at    #
# Steve Shafer's request, from parseCovariateTable.R in the               #
# Integrity-Analysis repository - which Claude Code (model: Claude Fable   #
# 5) drafted on 2026-08-14. The logic here is unchanged from that draft;   #
# the only edits were mechanical: the internal prefix `.pcv` became `.pp`, #
# and the original single file was split into utils.R / tokenize.R /       #
# pageLayout.R / parseBaselineTableHeuristics.R.                          #

# appear at all. That is invisible until you look, and it is fatal here,
