# Written 2026-08-15 by Claude Code (model: Claude Opus 5, Anthropic) at   #
# Steve Shafer's request. New code, not ported from Integrity-Analysis.    #
#                                                                          #
# This is the ONLY file in the package that contacts a network service.    #
# It calls the Anthropic Messages API over raw HTTPS with httr2, because   #
# Anthropic publishes no official R SDK. Requests use structured outputs   #
# (output_config.format with a JSON schema), so the model must return the  #
# table in the exact shape declared in .ppTableSchemaJson() - there is no  #
# free-text parsing of the reply.                                          #
#                                                                          #
# The model is claude-opus-5 (list price at the time of writing: $5 per    #
# million input tokens, $25 per million output tokens - one table page is  #
# on the order of a few US cents).                                        #
#                                                                          #
# Two sources are supported. source = "table" sends one page and asks for   #
# the table on it. source = "prose" sends the article text and asks for     #
# baseline characteristics stated in the narrative: some trials never       #
# tabulate them, and in a 250-article sample about a third of the articles  #
# nothing could be extracted from were of that kind.                        #
#                                                                          #
# Status: the request-construction and response-decoding helpers are run   #
# and verified by tests/testthat/test-ai-fallback.R against canned JSON.    #
#                                                                          #
# source = "prose" has been RUN LIVE against claude-opus-5 and scored:     #
# over the ten corpus articles that report baseline data only in running   #
# text, it recovered 100 of Carlisle's 110 known mean/SD pairs (91%), with #
# eight of the ten fully recovered, for about $0.11 an article. The ten    #
# misses are not misreadings - the model located those values and excluded #
# them, disagreeing with Carlisle over what counts as baseline (duration   #
# of surgery; time points after T0). Do not "fix" that without deciding    #
# which definition the analysis wants.                                     #
#                                                                          #
# The widened definition of baseline in the prose system prompt came from  #
# that run: the first version listed only demographics, and the model      #
# dutifully discarded the pre-intervention physiological measurements that #
# Carlisle counts, scoring 2 of 14 on one article where it now scores 14.  #
#                                                                          #
# source = "table" has also been RUN LIVE, against the 21 corpus trials    #
# that have a baseline table the deterministic engine misread - all of     #
# which score zero against Carlisle. It recovered 205 of their 254 known   #
# pairs (81%), 14 of 21 articles completely, at about $0.055 an article.   #
#                                                                          #
# That path was worth only 50% until page selection was fixed. It chose    #
# the page by baseline vocabulary (.ppScorePage), which landed on prose    #
# discussing the results in seven of the 21 - and from the model's side an #
# empty page is indistinguishable from an article with no table, so those  #
# came back as flat refusals. It now selects by table caption              #
# (.ppBestCaptionPage), the same way the deterministic engine does.        #
#                                                                          #
# Trust note: numbers produced by this engine were read by a language      #
# model, not located on the page by coordinate. Every row it contributes   #
# is tagged "ai" in the result's `provenance` table. For research-integrity #
# work, check those rows against the printed table before relying on them. #
#                                                                          #
# 2026-08-26 (Claude Fable 5): pages with no text layer now travel as      #
# rendered PNG images (150 dpi, base64 content blocks) - the medRxiv      #
# harvest surfaced manuscripts whose Table 1 page alone is a scanned      #
# picture (10.1101/19007195), which no text route can reach. Image-page    #
# detection, selection priority, and the fully-scanned tesseract-assisted  #
# path are described at .ppImageOnlyPages and in parseBaselineTableAI.     #

#' Parse a baseline table with the Claude API
#'
#' Sends the text layer of the table page to the Anthropic Messages API and
#' asks for the table back as structured JSON. Use this when the deterministic
#' engine cannot read a table's typography; [parseBaselineTable()] calls it
#' for you when needed.
#'
#' Pages with no text layer — scanned pages, or tables pasted into the
#' manuscript as pictures — are sent as rendered page images instead, which
#' the model reads directly. In a mixed document the image-only pages are
#' tried first (when a manuscript's table was pasted in as a picture, that
#' is where it is). For a fully scanned document the table page is located
#' with a local OCR pass (requires the suggested `tesseract` package; the
#' OCR text is used only to pick the page — the page itself still travels
#' as an image).
#'
#' The values this function returns were read by a language model rather than
#' located on the page by coordinate, so they are tagged `"ai"` in the
#' result's `provenance` table. Check them against the printed table before
#' using them in an integrity analysis.
#'
#' Requires an API key in the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable (put it
#' in `~/.Renviron`, never in a script). One page costs a few US cents at
#' current `claude-opus-5` list prices.
#'
#' @inheritParams parseBaselineTableHeuristics
#' @param source `"table"` sends one page and asks for the table on it.
#'   `"prose"` sends the article text and asks for baseline characteristics
#'   stated in the narrative — some trials report age, weight and sex in a
#'   sentence in the Methods instead of tabulating them, and roughly a third
#'   of the articles this package cannot extract from are of that kind. Rows
#'   obtained this way are tagged `"ai-prose"` in `provenance`.
#' @param maxChars Ceiling on the number of characters of article text sent
#'   when `source = "prose"`, to bound the cost of one call.
#' @param model Anthropic model id. Defaults to `"claude-opus-5"`.
#' @param effort Reasoning effort passed to the API: `"low"`, `"medium"`,
#'   `"high"`, `"xhigh"` or `"max"`. Transcription does not need much;
#'   `"medium"` is the default.
#' @param maxTokens Output-token ceiling for the reply. Covers reasoning plus
#'   the JSON, so leave headroom.
#' @param hint Optional text passed to the model describing what a
#'   deterministic pass already established (arm names, arm N). Supplied
#'   automatically by [parseBaselineTable()].
#' @param apiKey API key. Defaults to the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment
#'   variable, which is the recommended way to supply it.
#' @param ocr,ocrDpi Read the article with OCR rather than its text layer, for
#'   scanned PDFs. Needs the `tesseract` package. This is the more promising
#'   route for a scan than the deterministic engine, which depends on word
#'   coordinates that OCR degrades — a model can read a noisy page the way a
#'   person does.
#'
#' @return An object of class `ParsePDFTable`, with `engine` `"ai"` and an
#'   extra `notes` element carrying the model's own caveats.
#' @export
