# app_globals.R — constants shared by the UI and server.
#
# PROVENANCE: was global.R at the repository root until the package
# restructure (phase 1, 2026-08-16); in phase 2 (same date) sumz() and
# outputComments() moved to their own files (R/sumz.R, R/outputComments.R,
# bodies untouched), leaving only the Monte Carlo replication constant here.
# The library() calls that used to open global.R live in run_app()
# (app_run.R). History for the earlier cleanup passes (2026-08-14) is in
# git; the FIX rationale comments travel with the code they explain.

# m is the MAXIMUM replication count per row for the Monte Carlo
# simulation (the final stage of the adaptive scheme - see the header of
# R/P_Calc.R and docs/statistics.md). Rows simulate in stages
# 1,000 -> 10,000 -> m, escalating only while the running mid-p is
# < 0.01, so a typical (unalarming) row costs 1,000 replicates - CHEAPER
# than the old flat 15,000 - while alarming rows get the precision that
# makes a "<0.0001" claim defensible (the 97.5% upper confidence bound
# must clear it, which needs ~30,000+ replicates at zero exceedances).
m <- 100000

# The arm-size ceiling, shared by the app and the API so one number
# governs both and the documentation can state it as a property of
# IntegrityAnalysis rather than of one entry point (Steve, 2026-08-28).
#
# Two reasons, in his words: the Monte Carlo for a trial with more than
# 5,000 subjects in an arm is computationally expensive; and trials that
# large are "almost certainly funded by large companies or government
# entities" which "typically institute detailed auditing and review of
# manuscripts", so an independent fraud screen adds little.
#
# Enforcement is in validateData(), the gate BOTH surfaces run - the
# ceiling previously existed only in apiService.R, so the app had no
# limit and the documented claim would have been false for every web
# user. R/P_Calc.R remains callable directly for anyone with the
# computing horsepower and a reason.
