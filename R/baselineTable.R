# baselineTable.R - the journal-style reconstructed baseline table
# (ISSUES.md issue 15).
#
# PROVENANCE: written by Claude Code (model Claude Fable 5), 2026-08-19,
# at Steve Shafer's request. The cell-per-line grid looks nothing like a
# manuscript's Table 1, so an editor cannot eyeball what IntegrityAnalysis
# thought the baseline data were. These functions rebuild, from the
# VALIDATED data, a per-trial table shaped the way journals print one -
# variables as rows, arms as columns, cells "mean (SD)",
# "median [Q1, Q3]", counts for categories - which is the artifact an
# editor compares against the manuscript page. Formatting uses the same
# rounding columns the analysis uses (ROUND_MEAN for the mean/median and
# quartiles, ROUND_DISPERSION for the SD when present), so the
# reconstruction shows the PRINTED precision the analysis assumed - if
# the reconstruction disagrees with the page, so did the analysis.
# Candidate for the API response too (docs/api-spec.md, open decision).

#' Format one number at the printed precision
#'
#' @param x numeric value (may be NA).
#' @param digits decimal places (NA is treated as 0).
#' @return character; "" for NA input.
#' @noRd
.fmtAt <- function(x, digits) {
  if (is.na(x)) return("")
  if (is.na(digits)) digits <- 0
  sprintf("%.*f", as.integer(digits), x)
}

#' Reconstruct journal-style baseline tables from validated data
#'
#' One data frame per trial. Within a trial, the lines sharing a ROW value
#' are that variable's arms, in the order they appear (the validated data
#' preserves within-variable line order); arm k of every variable is the
#' same study arm, which is how the template has always been organized.
#'
#' Layout choices, made for the editor's eyeball comparison:
#' - Column headers carry the arm N ("Arm 1 (n = 15)") taken as the most
#'   common N among that arm's continuous lines; a line whose N differs
#'   (dropouts, missing data) gets "; n = X" appended in its own cell.
#' - A continuous variable prints as "mean (SD)"; a median/IQR variable
#'   (Q1/Q3 filled) prints as "median [Q1, Q3]"; the label says which.
#' - A category variable becomes a header line ("Sex, n") followed by one
#'   indented line per category column, with counts.
#'
#' @param DATA the VALIDATED data frame (validateData()$DATA).
#' @param CategoryNames character vector of category column names
#'   (validateData()$CategoryNames), or NULL.
#' @return named list of data.frames, one per trial, in trial order.

  ## 4 -- Provenance: WHICH ENGINE PRODUCED THIS VERDICT
  #
  # Added 2026-08-27. AGENTS.md has justified renv since 2026-08-20 on
  # the grounds that "an integrity finding may be challenged, and the
  # exact computational environment is on record is part of the
  # defense." The environment was on record in the REPOSITORY. It was
  # not on record in the ARTIFACT - the workbook is what leaves the
  # building, lands in an editorial file, and gets attached to an email
  # six months later, and it carried no version of any kind.
  #
  # So an author disputing a finding could ask "which version produced
  # this, and can you reproduce it?" and the honest answer was that
  # nobody could tell. For a tool whose output is used to question
  # whether someone's data are real, that is the wrong answer to be
  # unable to give.
  #
  # A separate sheet rather than a header row: the three existing sheets
  # have pinned shapes that tests and downstream readers depend on, and
  # provenance should not be something a reader has to scroll past.
