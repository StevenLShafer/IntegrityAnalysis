# Written 2026-08-15 by Claude Code (model: Claude Opus 5, Anthropic) at   #
# Steve Shafer's request. The column contract it targets comes from        #
# Template.xlsx / Example.xlsx and server.R in the Integrity-Analysis      #
# repository; the spreadsheet-writing call was factored out of             #
# parseCovariateTable() during the port.                                   #
# Status: run and verified by tests/testthat/test-write-template.R,        #
# which round-trips the file with openxlsx and checks the column contract. #

#' Write a parsed table as an Integrity-Analysis input spreadsheet
#'
#' Writes `x$data` to the first worksheet in the layout the IntegrityAnalysis
#' app expects (the full `.ppBaseColumns()` contract): `TRIAL`, `ROW`, `N`,
#' `MEAN`, `SD`, `SE`, `ROUND_MEAN`, `ROUND_DISPERSION`,
#' `ROUND_OBSERVATION`, then one integer column per category. `SD` and `SE`
#' are separate columns and are never converted into each other; a row
#' carries whichever the paper printed, and `ROUND_DISPERSION` records that
#' value's printed precision. Continuous rows carry N / MEAN / SD-or-SE and
#' the rounding columns; categorical rows leave those blank and carry counts
#' in the category columns, which is what the app's own validation requires.
#'
#' Two further worksheets are added by default. They sit after the data, so
#' the app - which reads the first worksheet - is unaffected, but the
#' provenance travels with the file:
#'
#' * **Provenance** - one line per data row, recording whether it came from
#'   the deterministic engine or from the model.
#' * **Skipped** - the table lines the parser could not use, and why.
#'
#' @param x A `ParsePDFTable` from [parseBaselineTable()].
#' @param file Path to the `.xlsx` file to write.
#' @param extraSheets Write the Provenance and Skipped worksheets. Set to
#'   `FALSE` for a single-worksheet file.
#' @param overwrite Overwrite `file` if it already exists.
#'
#' @return `file`, invisibly.
#' @seealso [parseBaselineTable()]
#' @export
