# P_Calc.R — the Monte Carlo analysis of one trial.
#
# PROVENANCE: moved out of app_server() in phase 2 of the package
# restructure (Claude Code, model Claude Fable 5, 2026-08-16); the function
# takes DATA, CategoryNames and m as explicit arguments so it can be called
# (and tested) without a running Shiny session. Every FIX comment from the
# 2026-08-14 bug-fix pass travels with its code. 2026-08-17: one-sided
# toward homogeneity (issue 6), median/IQR metalog branch (issue 12),
# degenerate-category refusal, and the ADAPTIVE STAGED scheme below
# (Steve's decision after the replicate-count discussion; independently
# convergent with a Gemini analysis he commissioned).
#
# THE STAGED SCHEME, in brief (full user documentation: docs/statistics.md):
#   - Each row simulates in stages: 1,000 -> 10,000 -> mMax (100,000)
#     replicates, advancing only while the running mid-p is < 0.01. Clean
#     rows stop at 1,000; only alarming rows pay for precision.
#   - Point estimate: mid-p (ties count half - the Carlisle-validated
#     convention), floored at 1/(m+1) (Davison & Hinkley: the Monte Carlo
#     test is exact-valid; a simulated p of literally 0 is never reported).
#   - Display: a row shows "<0.0001" ONLY when the one-sided 97.5%
#     Clopper-Pearson upper bound on the exceedance count clears 0.0001 -
#     the claim is licensed by the upper confidence limit, not the point
#     estimate. Ties count FULLY toward the bound (conservative).
#   - The trial p (Stouffer across rows) is closed-form arithmetic with no
#     simulation noise of its own and is NOT floored - accumulation across
#     rows is the fraud signal (Fujii). Its Monte Carlo uncertainty is
#     propagated from the rows' binomial counts by parametric bootstrap
#     and reported as a 95% interval whenever the trial p < 0.001.

#' Staged tail simulation: escalate replicates only when the row alarms
#'
#' Runs `simulate(n)` (a closure returning n simulated statistics) in
#' cumulative stages 1,000 / 10,000 / `mMax`, stopping early once the
#' running mid-p is >= 0.01 - precision there is worthless. Returns the
#' accumulated counts below (`kLess`) and tied with (`kEq`) `statObs`,
#' and the replicates actually used (`m`).

#' Monte Carlo integrity analysis of one trial's baseline table
#'
#' Reports a single **one-sided p-value toward excessive homogeneity**
#' (issue 6): P = the probability, under the null hypothesis of random
#' sampling, of baseline data **at least as homogeneous** as observed.
#' Small p = suspiciously homogeneous - the demonstrated fraud signal
#' (Fujii). Heterogeneity is deliberately not reported.
#'
#' Per row: continuous rows (all arms carry an N) simulate rounded
#' per-arm means under a common population (Carlisle-validated, issue 3);
#' median/IQR rows (Q1/Q3 filled; MEAN read as the median) use a 3-term
#' metalog matched to the pooled quartiles and compare rounded arm
#' MEDIANS; categorical rows simulate contingency tables under fixed
#' margins (`r2dtable`) and take the LOWER chi-square tail (counts more
#' alike than chance). All rows use the staged replicate scheme and
#' confidence-bounded reporting described at the top of this file, and
#' combine across the trial with Stouffer's [sumz()] - unfloored, with a
#' parametric-bootstrap 95% Monte Carlo interval when small.
#'
#' @section Calling P_Calc directly:
#'
#' IntegrityAnalysis declines trials with more than 5,000 subjects in any
#' arm (see the user guide, "Trials too large to analyze"). An
#' investigator with adequate computing horsepower can run the same
#' Monte Carlo by calling this function themselves - it has no
#' dependency on Shiny, on the parser, or on the size ceiling, which is
#' enforced in `validateData()` rather than here. Source this file, or
#' the package, and call it directly.
#'
#' The four arguments are described below. `DATA` is the one that
#' repays attention: everything else is a scalar or a name list.
#'
#' @param TRIAL the trial identifier. `P_Calc` analyses ONE trial per
#'   call and selects its rows with `DATA$TRIAL == TRIAL`, so `DATA` may
#'   hold many trials; loop over `unique(DATA$TRIAL)` for a whole file.
#'
#' @param DATA a data frame, **one row per variable per arm**. A
#'   two-arm trial reporting age, weight and sex is six rows: age twice,
#'   weight twice, sex twice. Rows are grouped by `ROW` within `TRIAL`,
#'   and the rows sharing a `ROW` value ARE the arms of that variable -
#'   there is no separate arm column, and arm order is the order the
#'   rows appear.
#'
#'   Required columns:
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{`TRIAL`}{trial identifier; matched against the `TRIAL` argument.}
#'     \item{`ROW`}{the variable name, e.g. "Age". Its repeats are the arms.}
#'     \item{`N`}{subjects in that arm for that variable.}
#'     \item{`MEAN`}{the arm mean - or, for a median row, the MEDIAN
#'       (see the row kinds below; the column is reused, not renamed).}
#'     \item{`SD`}{the arm standard deviation. `NA` for median and
#'       categorical rows.}
#'   }
#'
#'   Optional columns:
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{`SE`}{standard error, if the paper printed SE rather than
#'       SD; converted internally. Give one or the other, not both.}
#'     \item{`Q1`, `Q3`}{the quartiles, for a median row.}
#'     \item{`ROUND_MEAN`}{decimal places the MEAN was PRINTED to. This
#'       is not cosmetic - the whole method rests on rounding simulated
#'       values exactly as the paper rounded its own. 0 means integers.}
#'     \item{`ROUND_DISPERSION`}{decimals printed for SD/SE.}
#'     \item{`ROUND_OBSERVATION`}{decimals the UNDERLYING OBSERVATIONS
#'       were recorded to, which is often finer than the printed mean -
#'       ages recorded whole but a mean printed to one decimal.}
#'     \item{category columns}{one column per category level, holding
#'       COUNTS, named in `CategoryNames`. See below.}
#'   }
#'
#'   **The three kinds of row, and how they are told apart** - by which
#'   columns are filled, never by a type flag:
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{continuous}{every arm has a non-NA `N`, and `MEAN`/`SD` are
#'       filled. Simulates rounded per-arm means under one common
#'       population.}
#'     \item{median / IQR}{`Q1` and `Q3` are filled and every arm has an
#'       `N`; `MEAN` carries the MEDIAN and `SD` is `NA`. Fits a 3-term
#'       metalog to the pooled quartiles and compares rounded arm
#'       medians.}
#'     \item{categorical}{the category columns hold counts and `N`,
#'       `MEAN`, `SD` are all `NA` on those rows. Simulates contingency
#'       tables under fixed margins and takes the LOWER chi-square tail.
#'       `validateData()` enforces the exclusivity: a line carrying a
#'       category value must not also carry N/MEAN/SD.}
#'   }
#'
#'   A minimal two-arm continuous example:
#'   \preformatted{
#'   DATA <- data.frame(
#'     TRIAL = "T1",
#'     ROW   = c("Age", "Age", "Weight", "Weight"),
#'     N     = c(50, 52, 50, 52),
#'     MEAN  = c(60.1, 60.3, 72.4, 72.9),
#'     SD    = c(10.2, 9.8, 12.1, 11.7),
#'     ROUND_MEAN = 1, ROUND_OBSERVATION = 1,
#'     stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
#'   P_Calc("T1", DATA, NULL, 100000)
#'   }
#'
#'   Running `DATA` through [validateData()] first is recommended but not
#'   required - it normalises column names, checks the contract, and
#'   returns `$DATA` and `$CategoryNames` ready for this function. It
#'   also applies the 5,000 ceiling, so callers who deliberately want a
#'   larger trial should skip it and supply a well-formed frame directly.
#'
#' @param CategoryNames character vector naming the category (count)
#'   columns in `DATA`, or `NULL` when the trial has none. These are the
#'   columns treated as contingency-table counts; any column not named
#'   here and not a base column is ignored. `validateData()` returns the
#'   right value in `$CategoryNames`.
#'
#' @param m maximum replicates per row - the final stage of the adaptive
#'   scheme. The app uses 100,000. Rows resolve at 1,000 unless they look
#'   alarming, so this is a ceiling, not a cost: typical rows never
#'   approach it. Lower it to trade precision for speed on a large trial;
#'   the reported `M` column says what each row actually used.
#' @return a data.frame with columns TRIAL, ROW, P, CI95, M: one row per
#'   data ROW (M = replicates actually used; CI95 = upper bound, shown
#'   when P < 0.001), then a "Summary" row with the combined p and its
#'   bootstrap interval, then a blank spacer row.
