# PROVENANCE: was server.R at the repository root until the package
# restructure (phase 1, Claude Code model Claude Fable 5, 2026-08-16 — see
# docs/package-restructure-plan.md); phase 2 (same date) then moved the
# computation out: P_Calc() to R/P_Calc.R (now taking DATA, CategoryNames
# and m as arguments instead of reading them from this environment),
# is_category() and the upload-validation pipeline to R/validateData.R
# (returning derived state instead of assigning it with <<-). Verified
# bit-identical under fixed seeds against the phase-1 build. What remains
# here is Shiny wiring: reactives, observers, download handlers.
#
# PROVENANCE: Bug-fix pass by Claude Code (model: Claude Fable 5), 2026-08-14,
# on the 2025-09-01 original. Each fix is commented in place with "FIX:".
# All fixes verified by running the app locally against Example.xlsx
# (see PR description for the list and rationale).
#
# Add adjustment to SD for number of subjects
# Add ability to download raw data
# Add line by line integrity checks
# Determine categoricals by Integer only and < 6 types
# Permit comments in file
# Results file should only add P values to original file
# Enforce order: Trial ROW (P value) N MEAN SD
# For Observations decimals, just look for OBS. New name will be Round_Observations
# For Mean Dec, just look for an MEAN that does not equal "MEAN"
# Look for rapid rnorm function
# Cutoff for number of categories (probably 5)

  # THE PURGE GUARANTEE (Steve's requirement, 2026-08-17): when the
  # session ends, no record of the analysis survives. Uploaded files
  # (manuscript PDFs and spreadsheets) are deleted from disk along with
  # the per-upload temp directories Shiny created for them; the in-memory
  # state (data, results, log) dies with the session environment. Nothing
  # in this app writes analysis content anywhere else: downloads are
  # generated straight into the response, outputComments() keeps no file
  # log, and bookmarking is not enabled. Manuscripts under review are
  # confidential - this is a promise to the people uploading them, and
  # any future code path that touches an uploaded file must preserve it.

  ###########################################################
  # Steve's request (2026-08-17): every input path lands its table in an
  # editable grid (rhandsontable, the same machinery stanpumpR uses) so
  # the data can be inspected and corrected BEFORE any statistics run.
  # Validation still runs automatically on upload - a clean file goes
  # straight to the Analyze button, exactly as before - but the user can
  # now fix what validation flags (a missing N, a mistyped SD) directly
  # in the grid and revalidate, instead of editing the file and
  # re-uploading. Revalidation is EXPLICIT (a button), not per-keystroke:
  # each validation pass writes line-by-line messages to the comments
  # log, and firing it on every cell edit would bury the user in output.

  # Issue 13 (Steve's design): validation problems paint their CELLS -
  # yellow = missing, red = unreadable, blue = incongruent - so review
  # means looking at the table, not reading a log. rIssues holds the
  # (row, col, code) map from the last validateData pass.
  rIssues <- reactiveVal(NULL)

  # Table lines the PDF parser saw but could not use (r$skipped) become
  # GRID ROWS - label in ROW, everything else empty - so a parse loss is
  # a conspicuous colored row to fill in or delete, never a silent gap
  # (the PMID 14984519 lesson: missed variables diluted a real alarm).
  # This registry holds (TRIAL, ROW, reason); the renderer matches it
  # against the displayed frame by TRIAL + ROW (indices survive edits)
  # and paints the ROW cell red with the parser's reason as the hover
  # text. A row stops matching - and stops being red - the moment the
  # user fills any data into it, which is exactly right.
