# Empty rounding columns must not crash validation.
#
# PROVENANCE: written by Claude Code (model Claude Fable 5), 2026-08-19,
# with the fix in R/validateData.R. Found live during PR #22 testing:
# the blank-table starter ships ROUND_MEAN / ROUND_OBSERVATION as empty
# (all-NA) columns, and typing a DECIMAL mean then hit
# `if (DATA$ROUND_MEAN[i] < digits)` with NA - a fatal error that killed
# the whole Shiny session. An empty rounding cell means "infer it": NAs
# fill with 0 and the decimal bump raises them to the typed precision.
