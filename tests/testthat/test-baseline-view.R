# Issue 15: the journal-style reconstructed baseline table.
#
# PROVENANCE: written by Claude Code (model Claude Fable 5), 2026-08-19,
# with R/baselineTable.R. The reconstruction is built from the VALIDATED
# data (validateData()$DATA), so every test round-trips through
# validateData() exactly as the app does.
