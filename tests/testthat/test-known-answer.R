# Known-answer Monte Carlo cases under fixed seeds (ISSUES.md issue 4,
# second priority): a refactor must not silently change results.
#
# PROVENANCE: written by Claude Code (model Claude Fable 5), 2026-08-19.
# The pinned values were computed on R 4.5.3 / dqrng 0.4.1 with the
# engine as of the PR 21-25 merges. Under fixed seeds the engine is
# fully deterministic (sequential %do% row loop, chunking depends only
# on N), so equality is exact. If an INTENDED statistical change moves
# these numbers, re-pin them in the same commit and say why; if an
# upgrade of R or dqrng moves them, re-pin and note the version. A
# surprise failure here means the engine changed when it was not meant
# to.
#
# RE-PINNED 2026-09-04 with the exact combination (PR "the exact
# combination"): the staging is now per trial and each stage draws
# afresh rather than cumulatively, so the RNG stream a row sees at its
# final stage differs from before. "Three identical arms" moved from
# p = 3e-04 (bound <=0.0013) to 1e-04 (bound <=0.00072): the same row,
# the same 10,000 replicates, a different draw. The worked example
# (stage 1 only, identical draws) is unchanged at 0.0495.
