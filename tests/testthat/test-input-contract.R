# The input contract: column-name normalization and category detection.

# PROVENANCE: written by Claude Code (model Claude Fable 5), 2026-08-19,
# for the test-suite consolidation (ISSUES.md issue 4, first priority).
# These rules are the app's public interface - a spreadsheet written for
# any earlier version must keep validating identically - and were
# previously exercised only implicitly.
