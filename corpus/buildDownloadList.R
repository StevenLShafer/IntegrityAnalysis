# buildDownloadList.R - build the PRIORITIZED MANUAL DOWNLOAD LIST for
# the Carlisle corpus: .NewCarlisle/DownloadPriorityList.xlsx.
#
# PROVENANCE: written by Claude Code (model Claude Opus 5), 2026-08-19,
# to Steve Shafer's design, after the automated routes were exhausted.
# The automated passes (corpus/downloadNewCarlisle.R for the PMC open
# access subset, corpus/unpaywallDiscovery.R for the license census)
# together reach only a few hundred of the 5,088 trials legally. The
# rest have to be fetched BY HAND, a handful per day, through Stanford's
# Lane Library proxy - individual downloads are within Lane's terms;
# bulk retrieval is not, and no script here does it.
#
# So the deliverable is a worklist, not a downloader: one row per trial,
# SORTED ASCENDING BY THE CARLISLE TRIAL P-VALUE, because the lowest
# p-values are the trials whose baseline tables are most worth having.
# Steve works down the list; every row carries the links he needs (DOI,
# PubMed, the Lane proxy, and any free open-access copy) and the exact
# file name to save the PDF under.
#
# Usage:
#   "C:\Program Files\R\R-4.5.3\bin\Rscript.exe" corpus/buildDownloadList.R
# Reads only; safe to re-run at any time (and worth re-running as the
# unpaywall census and the manual downloads progress).
