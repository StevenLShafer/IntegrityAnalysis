# compareResults.R - compare the mass-test ActualResults against the
# Carlisle-derived ExpectedResults, ON THE LOG SCALE.
#
# PROVENANCE: written by Claude Code (model Claude Fable 5), 2026-08-17.
# The log transform is Steve's specification: "0.0001 is as far from
# 0.001 as the latter is from 0.01" - p-values live on a multiplicative
# scale, and agreement must be measured there, or the comparison is
# dominated by trivial absolute differences among mid-range values while
# ignoring order-of-magnitude disagreements in the tail that actually
# matter. Both sides are log10-transformed before any statistic.
#
# Usage: Rscript corpus/compareResults.R
# Reads  corpus/ActualResults.xlsx (the mass-test run) and
#        corpus/ExpectedResults.xlsx (built from the Carlisle files alone)
# Writes corpus/Comparison.xlsx and prints the agreement summary.

repo <- Sys.getenv("INTEGRITY_ROOT", "C:/dev/IntegrityAnalysis")

# Optional args: [actualFile] [comparisonOut] (paths under corpus/),
# so the continuous-only run compares without clobbering the full-table
# comparison: Rscript corpus/compareResults.R ActualResults_continuous.xlsx
#             Comparison_continuous.xlsx
