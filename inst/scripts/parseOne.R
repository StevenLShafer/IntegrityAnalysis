# parseOne.R - parse a single PDF in a throwaway R process.

# Written 2026-08-15 by Claude Code (model: Claude Opus 5, Anthropic) at   #
# Steve Shafer's request, after a corpus run showed that a malformed PDF   #
# can hang poppler indefinitely. Adapted for IntegrityAnalysis 2026-08-17  #
# (Claude Code, model Claude Fable 5) when the ParsePDF fold-in (PR #9)    #
# turned out to have missed inst/scripts entirely: locally the retired     #
# ParsePDF installation silently supplied this script, so everything       #
# worked; on shinyapps.io there is no ParsePDF and every PDF upload        #
# failed instantly. Found by Steve testing PR #10 with Test1.              #
#                                                                          #
# This script exists because R cannot interrupt a C library that has      #
# stopped returning: setTimeLimit only fires between R evaluations, so a  #
# hang inside poppler is unkillable in-process. Running each file in its  #
# own process makes the operating system, rather than R, responsible for  #
# enforcing the time limit.                                               #
#                                                                          #
# It is invoked by parseBaselineTableFiles(); there is no reason to run it#
# by hand. Arguments: <optionsRds> <outputRds> <pdfFile>. A .docx path    #
# flows through unchanged - parseBaselineTable() dispatches by extension  #
# internally (issue 19), so do NOT "fix" the pdfFile= name here.          #
# Status: run and verified by tests/testthat/test-batch.R, with the       #
# masking ParsePDF installation removed from the machine first.           #
